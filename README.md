1. Create a Book class which stores the follwing information 
about the book as instance variables:
       authorlast, 
       authorfirst, 
       title, 
       place, 
       publisher, 
       and year
   Also create a instance method:
    "write_bib_entry" 
   which returns a formatted bibliographic reference for the book.
   
2. Create a two instances of Book class in the name of "beauty" and "pynut":
    For getting all the info about authors and other details,
    please make a Google search with below book names:
    book1: The Evidential Power of Beauty
    book2: Python in a Nutshell
    
3. How would you print out the book attribute of the pynut instance?


4. If you type print beauty.write_bib_entry() at the interpreter, what will happen?

5. How would you change the publication year for the beauty book to "2021" and
print it back?
